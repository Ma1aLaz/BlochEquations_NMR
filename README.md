# BlochEquations_NMR

This contains the supplementary materials for the AMA3002 Solo Project on the Bloch Equations. The below description will refer to the equation and figure numbers from the report.

Included in this repo:

1. a pdf file ("Handwritten_Equations.pdf") containing the handwritten derivations of Eqns 3, 5, and 6 from the Bloch equations (Eq 1)

2. a pdf file ("Handwritten_Solutions.pdf") containing the handwritten solutions to Eq 4 - so the Bloch equations with B = (0,0,B_0) - under the initial condition M(t=0) = (M_0, 0 0)
   
3. a png ("Analytic_B_0.png"), showing the analytic solution derived in "Handwritten_Solutions", which should be identical to Fig. 1
   
4. a png ("Inversion_Recovery.png"), showing the numerical solution to Eq. 3 with initial condition M(t=0) = (0, 0 -M_0), which is called an "inversion recovery" experiment. This is unmentioned in the report but shows Eq. 3 for different initial conditions.
   
5. a png ("Still_Axes_Res_and_OffRes.png"), showing the still axes versions of Figs 2, 4
   
6. a png ("Frequency_Sweep.png"), showing the frequency sweep (so a version of Fig 3) in both coordinate systems but found from the magnetisations after 10*T, rather than setting derivatives to 0. The rotating axes frequency sweep should be near-identical to Fig 3.
